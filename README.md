# Lab 4 - Event Delegation, closest(), and matches()

This lab demonstrates:

- Event delegation: attaching a listener to a parent element
- `closest()`: walking up the DOM tree safely
- `matches()`: filtering events by selector
- Dynamic DOM manipulation for accordions, tags, filterable cards, and inline editing
